# "Recognized" a peer recognition tool domain

## Why?

There are a few reasons I am writing this tool.

- to learn TypeScript
- to give Clean Architecture a try, when most of the app architectures follow the framework
- to make a tool I could use at my workplace for peer recognition

## Architecture

As mentioned above, this repository is an attempt to build an application following Clean Architecture proposed by Robert C. Martin.

## Tech Stack

### Domain

- plain TypeScript
- Mocha and Chai for tests
